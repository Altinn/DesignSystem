# Json Tab Plugin for Pattern Lab Node

The Json Tab Plugin allows Pattern Lab Node users to see the data for each pattern (pattern.jsonFileData), displaying it as an additional tab alongside the template and HTML tabs in both the Style Guide frontend and the single-pattern info modal.

## Installation

To add the Json Tab Plugin to your project using [npm](http://npmjs.com/) type:

    npm install git+https://github.com/Altinn/plugin-node-json-tab.git --save

Or add it directly to your project's `package.json` file and run `npm install`

## Enabling / Disabling the Plugin

After install, you may manually enable or disable the plugin by removing it from the `patternlab-config.json` file. Installation added a key called `plugin-node-json-tab` to it.
